# DEVOPS  

Standardisation and Automisation (provisioning) <- We will use this to make processes much more efficient



Four Pillars (CERF)




1) Cost - DLIC
Decreased errors (Only works on one computer) (standardize environments)
Less downtime
Increased speed of deployment - gain time
Choosing the right infrastructure





2) Ease of Use (Abstract-esque)
People can use the code without too much stress (developers)
example - just type in vagrant-up - and code will be available



3) Robustness
Standardize Environment
Resilient structrure
       - N-tier architecture




4) Flexibility (don't rely on just one technology)
Ability to adapt/ implement new technologies`

CODE PIPELINE

Different environments (PTD)

Production Environment - Where the code is accessible to general public
Testing Environment - Where they test the code
Development Environment - where they create the code

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CI - Continuous Integration
 Process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control.
(With every build, it tests and gives feedback)

CD - Continuous Delivery
Code is always in a  release ready state

CD - Continuous Deployment
Usually for SaaS(software of a service) - changes are deployed as soon as possible
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Types of Testing

Unit Testing
Integration testing
System testing
Acceptance testing
